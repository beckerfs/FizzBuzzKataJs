## FizzBuzz Kata

### Requirements
Write a program that returns the numbers from 1 to 100​
- For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number​
- For multiples of five return “Buzz”​ instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, return “FizzBuzz”
- Write tests for the code you are writing / you have written.

You can use a TDD approach, or write tests when you've written some or all of the code.

### Additional information
- This project uses **Jest** as the testing framework.
- Feel free to ask questions.
- We are interested in your thought process, so it would be great if you could talk about what you are doing
and why you are doing it.
